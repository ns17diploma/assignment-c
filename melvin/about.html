				The Club is firmly based on the beliefs and principles established by Gichin Funakoshi (1868-1957)

				The priciples the Shotokan School is based upon the details below. 

				Never forget: karate begins with rei and ends with rei (Rei means courtesy or respect, and is represented in karate by bowing)
				There is no first attack in karate
				Karate supports righteousness
				First understand yourself, then understand others
				The art of developing the mind is more important than the art of applying technique
				The mind needs to be freed
				Trouble is born of negligence / ignorance
				Do not think karate belongs only in the dojo
				Karate training requires a lifetime
				Transform everything into karate; therein lies its exquisiteness
				Karate is like hot water, if you do not give it heat constantly, it will again become cold water
				Do not think that you have to win, rather think you do not have to lose
				Transform yourself according to the opponent
				The outcome of the fight depends on one's control
				Imagine one's arms and legs as swords
				Once you leave the shelter of home, there are a million enemies
				Postures are for the beginner; later they are natural positions
				Perform the kata correctly; the real fight is a different matter
				Do not forget control of the dynamics of power, the elasticity of the body and the speed of the technique
				Apply the way of Karate to all things. Therein lies its beauty.
